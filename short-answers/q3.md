What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer

The difference between `rest` operator and a `spread` operator is  `rest` are for functions (the rest operator is placed inside the parameters of the function) to get the rest of an argument. While `spread` are for arrays/strings that want to be iterated all throughout.
