# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
`name` since it's a primitive, it can only pass by value while `favoriteLocations` are pass by reference, meaning that the values inside the array is stored in memory by its space.  
# Teacher Feedback
Yup! Because arrays are passed by reference, they can be mutated!
